- [ ] powerups flash before disappearing
- [ ] Multiplayer controls
- [ ] multiplayer "opt in screen"
- [ ] timer so games last "x" minutes
- [ ] Win Scenario - all enemies or dead, or exit door mechanism.  
- [ ] level generator to include settings file? For e.g. number of powerups (type of powerups?) based on stage
- [ ] Arcade mode to add "stage based settings"
- [ ] level generator and board manager are seperated out
