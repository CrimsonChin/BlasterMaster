## TODO 
- [ ] End of game screen

- [ ] player dies from enemy contact
- [ ] Powerups flash before disappearing
- [ ] Multiplayer controls
- [ ] Multiplayer "opt in screen"
- [ ] Timer so games last "x" minutes
- [ ] Win Scenario - all enemies or dead, or exit door mechanism.  
- [ ] Level generator to include settings file? For e.g. number of powerups (type of powerups?) based on stage
- [ ] Arcade mode to add "stage based settings"
- [ ] Level generator and board manager are seperated out
- [ ] Scoring metrics, scores based on levels bombs used, kills, etc.  Trophy mechanism.
